\chapter*{Preface}

	As the 1968 film \emph{2001: A Space Odyssey} gave an enigmatic and scientifically accurate depiction of space flight,
	so Jeffrey O.~Shallit and Ming-Wei Wang's paper \emph{Automatic complexity of strings}~\cite{MR1897300} from 2001
	described what we can call a ``state odyssey'':
	journeys through the states of a finite automaton that held the promise of further deep exploration.

	\paragraph*{Acknowledgments.}
	I am grateful to many people.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Andrew J.I.~Jones, Dag Normann, Theodore A.~Slaman, and many others mentored me in computability and logic.
		\item In a Discrete Mathematics class in Spring 2009, students
			Jason Axelson, Chris Ho and Aaron Kondo wrote a C program that calculated the complexity of all strings of length at most 7.
			The dedication they put into that program fueled my interest in automatic complexity.
		\item Logan Axon wrote the first Python script for automatic complexity.
		\item Kayleigh K.~Hyde's 2013 Master's project and
			her proof of the sharp upper bound for nondeterministic automatic complexity sparked my interest in proving theorems in this area.
		\item Students who have worked with me on automatic complexity include Samuel D.~Birns, Calvin K.~Bannister, Swarnalakshmi (Janani) Lakshmanan and Daylan K.~Yogi.
		\item Jeff Shallit, Achilles Beros, Nikolai Vereshchagin, Sasha Shen, Andr\'e Nies, Frank Stephan and Angeliki Koutsoukou-Argyraki
			provided encouragement and interesting discussions.
