\chapter*{Preface}

	As the 1968 film \emph{2001: A Space Odyssey} gave an enigmatic and scientifically accurate depiction of space flight,
	so Jeffrey O.~Shallit and Ming-Wei Wang's paper \emph{Automatic complexity of strings}~\cite{MR1897300} from 2001
	described what we can call a ``state odyssey'':
	journeys through the states of a finite automaton that held the promise of further deep exploration.

	While Kolmogorov complexity is only defined ``up to an additive constant'', automatic complexity gives concrete values. When I start up the
	Complexity Guessing Game at \url{http://math.hawaii.edu/wordpress/bjoern/software/web/complexity-guessing-game/}
	on November 14, 2021, I am presented with the string $x=011000111001010$ of length 15, and asked to guess its complexity,
	from 1 to 8.
	As we shall see in this book, in particular in \Cref{chap:FMS},
	the best bet is to choose the largest complexity offered (8 in this case) unless you spot something very special about $x$.
	This is correct for our $x$ and next I am asked about the length 25 word
	\begin{equation}\label{y-word}
		y=1011001111101111010100101
	\end{equation}
	and for a guess for its complexity, from 1 to 13.
	Again I choose the maximum, but in this case, the game responds that the complexity is 12
	and that there is a complexity \emph{deficiency} of 1.

	The idea of complexity (or randomness) deficiency comes from the study of Kolmogorov complexity.
	However, automatic complexity is a more manageable (and computable) measure of irregularity.
	When we say ``irregularity'' here it is partly a pun:
	automatic complexity is based on finite automata, that accept regular languages,
	so irregularity indicates a failure of small finite automata to uniquely identify the string in a sense.

	The game provides the finite automaton for $y$ from \Cref{y-word} shown in \Cref{y-automaton}.

\chapter{The incompressibility theorem}\label{chap:FMS}

	Shallit and Wang showed that the automatic complexity $A(x)$ satisfies $A(x)\ge n/13$ for almost all $x\in{\{\mt{0},\mt{1}\}}^n$.
	They also stated that Holger Petersen had informed them that the constant 13 can be reduced to 7.
	Here we show that it can be reduced to $2+\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon>0$.
	The result also applies to nondeterministic automatic complexity $A_N(x)$.
	In that setting the result is tight inasmuch as $A_N(x)\le n/2+1$ for all $x$.
